This program creates four pointer barriers around each XRandR screen,
thus effectively jailing your mouse pointer to one physical screen.

Pointer barriers are mostly useful when there is more than one physical
screen connected to your computer. Properly placed barriers can then
make you feel like you're sitting in front of only one screen: When you
throw your mouse in the upper right corner, it does not suddenly switch
to another monitor.

Installation
------------

The following C libraries are required:

    - libx11
    - libxfixes
    - libxrandr

The XFIXES extension must be available on your X server.

xpointerbarrier expects to be run on a POSIX-ish operating system.

To build the program and install it to /usr/local:

    $ make
    # make install


Running
-------

Simply run the program in your ~/.xinitrc:

    $ xpointerbarrier 47 7 7 27

It's probably best to first configure your screens, then run the
program.
